# C Compiler Working (GNU Linux)

## The Process

The Compilation is the process of converting high level language into low level language and an executable file

There are fours stages undergone in this process before generating the final output executable file, they are listed below as follows
1. Pre Processor
2. Compiler
3. Assembler
4. Linker

## The Preprocessor
There are three responsiblity for preprocessors firstly it removes all the comments from the file, replaces the macro with the values everywhere in the program and searches for the header files used in the program. The System defined header files denoted by angle brackets Ex: #include <stdio.h> are searched in the /usr/include/ directory and the user defined header files are searched in the current working directory. The user defined header files are denoted with double quotes Ex: #include "somefile.h"

Cool, let's now see with an example by running the follwing command and generate the preprocessor output file with the **.i** extension

> hey man
